196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.


Input: 
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output: 
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.


sol:

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
)
AND email IN (
    SELECT email
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
