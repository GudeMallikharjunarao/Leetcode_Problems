1. How do you handle duplicate values in a Pandas DataFrame?

Ans: 
--- check null values in the entire Dataframe.df.isnull()
-- Remove rows with null values using df_1 = df.dropna()
--Fill null values with a constraint = df.fillna(value=0)
--interpolate() –

By default, this function fills the missing or NaN values with the linear interpolated values. However, you can customize the interpolation technique to polynomial, time, index, spline, etc., using its ‘method’ parameter.

The interpolation method is highly suitable for time series data, whereas fillna is a more generic approach.

2. What is the purpose of the apply() function in Pandas? Can you provide an example?

Ans: 

The apply() method is one of the most common methods of data preprocessing. It simplifies applying a function on each element in a pandas Series and each row or column in a pandas DataFrame.

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [10, 20]})


def square(x):
    return x * x


df1 = df.apply(square)

print(df)
print(df1)


3. How do you handle categorical data in Pandas?

Ans: 

Handling categorical data in Pandas involves several steps, including conversion to categorical types, encoding, and dealing with missing values.
